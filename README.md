# Boom Game

The Boom Game is a fun, interactive number game where you and the computer take turns counting from 1 to 100. The twist? Whenever the number is divisible by 7, or contains the digit 7, you must say "Boom" instead of the number! The game continues until one player makes a mistake, at which point the game ends.

## How to Play
1. Starting the Game:
  * You can choose whether you or the computer starts the game.
  * The game will prompt you to enter user or computer to decide who goes first.

2. Gameplay:
   * The game begins at 1 and progresses up to 100.
   *  Players take turns to either say the current number or "Boom" if the number is divisible by 7 or contains the digit 7 (like 17 or 77).
   *  If it's the user's turn:
     *  Type the correct number or "Boom" when prompted.
     *  If you make a mistake (e.g., saying "Boom" at the wrong time or entering the wrong number), the game ends.
    *  If it's the computer's turn:
      *  The computer will automatically play its turn by either printing the correct number or "Boom."

3. Winning and Losing:
  * The game continues until a mistake is made.
  * If you make an error, the game ends, and the computer wins.
  * If you correctly complete the sequence up to 100 without mistakes, you win the game!

4. Play Again:
  * After the game ends, you'll be asked if you want to play again.
  * Type 'yes' to start a new game or 'no' to exit.
